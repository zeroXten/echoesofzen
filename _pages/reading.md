# Philosophy and Religion

## Truth: Philosophy in Transit

Author: John D. Caputo\
Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/19070514>

### Summary

The book delves into philosophical discussions, examining how truth has been understood and reinterpreted through history, from ancient times to the present. Caputo challenges traditional notions of absolute truth, instead presenting a more dynamic and fluid understanding. He explores the impact of major philosophers like Heidegger, Derrida, and Nietzsche on the concept of truth, and addresses contemporary issues such as the role of truth in politics, religion, and science.

### What I got out of it

A useful antidote to the literalism that seems to be prevalent in all religions.

Without falling into the trap of Relativism, this book has helped me break free from the chains of Enlightenment and see the complexity of the world with more openness. You can read a fictional story about the Second World War, which although isn't actually true - the characters didn't exist and the events of the story didn't happy - there can be truth in the story. The emotions, the experiences, the decisions people have to take, all of that can truly reflect the challenges and heartache that people went through during the war. The same can be said for religious scriptures. While Jesus wasn't literally the son of God, his teachings reflect the human condition and provide an insight into and possibly some guidance for navigating life.

## God: A Human History

Author: Reza Aslan\
Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34101725-god>

### Summary

Aslan traces the history of human belief in God, starting from the earliest prehistoric times to the modern era. He examines the evolution of the concept of God, suggesting that the idea of a single, personal deity emerged as a reflection of our own human nature. The book delves into various religious traditions across the world, demonstrating how the conception of God has been shaped by human desires and fears.

Aslan argues that the anthropomorphization of God – attributing human characteristics to the divine – is a common theme across different religions. This tendency, he suggests, reveals more about human nature than about the divine itself. The book is not just a historical account but also includes Aslan's personal reflections on spirituality and the nature of faith.

### What I got out of it

A fascinating insight into the history and "evolution" of religion. The author describes himself as pantheistic, so you can read this book while maintaining some sort of belief in the supernatural. However, reading how different myths morph and blend throughout the ages, it is hard to take religious scripture as literal. The author makes the argument that the notion of the self or soul came first, probably as a side-effect of our evolution rather than religion emerging as any sort of evolutionary advantage. As our species developed, we created increasingly complex forms of spirual beliefs, from simple Animism to temples. 

## Buddhism without Beliefs: A Contemporary Guide to Awakening

Author: Stephen Batchelor\
Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/90557>

## Summary

Batchelor, a former monk in both the Tibetan and Zen traditions, presents Buddhism as a practical, secular approach to life, focusing on its philosophical and ethical aspects rather than religious beliefs or metaphysical doctrines.

The book advocates for a version of Buddhism grounded in critical inquiry and personal experience. Batchelor emphasizes the core Buddhist practices of mindfulness and compassion, suggesting that they can lead to a deeper understanding of the human condition and a more fulfilled life. He challenges the reader to view the Buddha not as a religious icon but as a human being who taught a way of life based on awareness, ethical conduct, and meditation.

## Alone with Others: An Existential Approach to Buddhism

Author: Stephen Batchelor\
Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/596076>

### Summary

In this work, Batchelor presents an interpretation of Buddhism through the lens of existentialism, focusing on the human condition and the experience of being alone in the world.

The book explores the idea that while we are inherently alone in our individual experiences, we are simultaneously connected with others through these experiences. Batchelor examines key Buddhist concepts such as suffering, impermanence, and no-self, and relates them to existential themes like freedom, absurdity, and authenticity.

### What I got out of it

I particularly like the division of the human condition long the dimensions of Being and Having. Our culture today is obsessed with Having, leading to a lot of dissatisfaction and suffering, and this book describes how secular Buddhism addresses the existential dimension of Being.  

## The Philosophy of Zen Buddhism

Author: Byung-Chul Han\
Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62238867-the-philosophy-of-zen-buddhism>

### Summary

Han examines key Zen concepts like mindfulness, the nature of reality, and the pursuit of enlightenment. He particularly focuses on the Zen understanding of emptiness, presenting it not as a void, but as a state of potential and interconnectedness. The book provides insights into how Zen principles influence art, poetry, and daily living, emphasizing simplicity and naturalness. Written in an accessible style, it serves as an excellent introduction to Zen Buddhism while offering deep reflections for those already familiar with its teachings.

Still reading this one.

## Why Religion Matters: The Fate of the Human Spirit in an Age of Disbelief

Author: Huston Smith\
Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25885.Why_Religion_Matters>

### Summary

In this book, Smith, a renowned scholar of religions, argues that the marginalization of religion in contemporary society has led to a spiritual crisis.

Smith critiques the dominance of scientific materialism and rationalism, suggesting that they have contributed to a loss of meaning and purpose in life. He asserts that while science excels in explaining the physical world, it falls short in addressing deeper existential questions and the human need for spiritual fulfillment.

The book delves into various religious traditions, highlighting their wisdom and insights into the human condition. Smith emphasizes the importance of these spiritual perspectives in providing a sense of connectedness, moral guidance, and a deeper understanding of the universe and our place in it.

# Science, Self, and Meditation

## Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art

Author: James Nestor\
Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48890486-breath>

### Summary

This book explores the often-overlooked importance of breathing and its impact on health and well-being. Nestor combines scientific research, historical context, and personal experimentation to reveal how modern humans have lost the art of proper breathing, leading to numerous health issues.

The book delves into the evolution of human respiratory physiology and how changes in our lifestyle and environment have led to chronic breathing dysfunctions. Nestor investigates various breathing techniques from around the world, examining their physiological effects and potential health benefits.

### What I got out of it

Apparently I have been taking breathing for granted. This was an eye opening book on the importance of different breathing techniques, especially breathing through your nose. Some of the science is a bit speculative, but the author makes no attempt to hide that fact. It provides a good physiological explanation for the importance of breathing in meditation, beyond just being an object of attention. At the end of the book he makes a brief by intriguing suggestion that Chi is essentially the transfer of electrons in the metabolic system of all living things.

## Why Buddhism Is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment

Author: Robert Wright\
Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32895535-why-buddhism-is-true>

### Summary

This book offers a unique perspective on Buddhism, aligning its teachings with modern psychological and evolutionary theory. Wright, a scholar and journalist, argues that the core principles of Buddhism are not only philosophically profound but also scientifically verifiable.

The book focuses on the Buddhist concepts of suffering, the illusion of the self, and the potential for personal liberation through mindfulness meditation. Wright explains how our brains, shaped by evolution, lead to natural tendencies of greed, hatred, and delusion, which Buddhism identifies as the root of suffering. He presents scientific evidence showing how meditation can help us understand and counteract these innate biases, leading to improved mental well-being.

### What I got out of it

As the summary suggests, this book makes a very strong case that many of the ideas and practices in Buddhism are scientifically valid. The insights that Siddhartha Gautama was able to achieve are only just starting to be understood two and a half thousand years later. He clearly obtained a profound understanding of the human mind and condition, and in my opinion this book reinforces the idea that you don't have to resort of literalism or the supernatural in order to appreciate the value and importance of Buddhism.
