# Philosophy and Religion

## Truth: Philosophy in Transit

Author: John D. Caputo\
Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/19070514>

### Summary

The book delves into philosophical discussions, examining how truth has been understood and reinterpreted through history, from ancient times to the present. Caputo challenges traditional notions of absolute truth, instead presenting a more dynamic and fluid understanding. He explores the impact of major philosophers like Heidegger, Derrida, and Nietzsche on the concept of truth, and addresses contemporary issues such as the role of truth in politics, religion, and science.

### What I got out of it

A useful antidote to the literalism that seems to be prevalent in all religions.

Without falling into the trap of Relativism, this book has helped me break free from the chains of Enlightment and see the complexity of the world with more openness. You can read a fictional story about the Second World War, which although isn't actually true - the characters didn't exist and the events of the story didn't happy - there can be truth in the story. The emotions, the experiences, the decisions people have to take, all of that can truly reflect the challenges and heartache that people went through during the war. The same can be said for religious scriptures. While Jesus wasn't literally the son of God, his teachings reflect the human condition and provide an insight into and possibly some guidance for navigating life.

## God: A Human History

Author: Reza Aslan\
Goodreads: <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34101725-god>

### Summary

Aslan traces the history of human belief in God, starting from the earliest prehistoric times to the modern era. He examines the evolution of the concept of God, suggesting that the idea of a single, personal deity emerged as a reflection of our own human nature. The book delves into various religious traditions across the world, demonstrating how the conception of God has been shaped by human desires and fears.

Aslan argues that the anthropomorphization of God – attributing human characteristics to the divine – is a common theme across different religions. This tendency, he suggests, reveals more about human nature than about the divine itself. The book is not just a historical account but also includes Aslan's personal reflections on spirituality and the nature of faith.

### What I got out of it

A fascinating insight into the history and "evolution" of religion. The author describes himself as pantheistic, so you can read this book while maintaining some sort of belief in the supernatural. However, reading how different myths morph and blend throughout the ages, it is hard to take religious scripture as literal. The author makes the argument that the notion of the self or soul came first, probably as a side-effect of our evolution rather than religion emerging as any sort of evolutionary advantage. As our species developed, we created increasingly complex forms of spirual beliefs, from simple Animism to temples.
