In the storm's fierce grasp\
Still waters hold the moonlight\
Compassion's embrace

Listening deeply\
Words soft as falling petals\
Anger meets kindness

Impermanent, swift\
Anger's shadow passes by\
Patience like the stars

Wishing well to all\
Heart filled with loving-kindness\
Peace blooms from within
