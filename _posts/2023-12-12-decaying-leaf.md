In his travels through the countryside, Master Gento encountered a solitary figure named Isamu, who was known for his deep-seated negativity and depressive view of life. Isamu lived in a small, dilapidated hut at the edge of a once vibrant village, now fallen into despair.

As Master Gento approached, he found Isamu staring blankly into the distance, his face etched with lines of sorrow and hopelessness.

"Why do you dwell in such sorrow?" asked Master Gento, sitting beside him.

Isamu sighed, "Life is an endless cycle of pain and suffering. Joy is a fleeting illusion. What is the purpose of seeking happiness when despair is all that awaits?"

Master Gento picked up a fallen, dry leaf from the ground and held it up. "This leaf, once a vibrant part of a tree, is now withered and lifeless. But is its journey truly over?"

Isamu looked at the leaf, puzzled.

"The leaf nourishes the soil, and from this soil, new life will spring," Master Gento explained. "In its decay lies the promise of renewal. So too is the nature of our sorrows. They are not the end, but a part of a larger cycle. Our despair can be the soil from which joy and understanding grow."

Isamu listened, the words seeping into his thoughts.

Master Gento continued, "Your current state, like this leaf, is but a moment in time. Embrace it not as an eternal truth, but as a step in the journey of transformation."

Isamu's perspective began to shift. He realized that his suffering, though real, was not the entirety of his existence. Inspired by Master Gento's words, he started to view his life as a cycle, understanding that moments of despair were as much a part of growth as moments of happiness. Slowly, Isamu began to rediscover the beauty in life, learning to find peace even amidst the sorrows, much like the tree that sheds its leaves only to bloom again.
