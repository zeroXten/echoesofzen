In the early dawn at the Digital Lotus Temple, Master Gento addressed his students with a challenging koan:

"Imagine you find a book that contains the story of your life. As you read the final page, it ends with your reading. Where are you in this story, and who is the reader?"

The students were jolted by the paradox, forced to confront the intertwining of creator and creation, and the elusive nature of self within their own life stories.
