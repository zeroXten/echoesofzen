In a small village near the mountains, there was a Zen temple where lived an old and wise master, Master Gento. Among his students was a young monk named Taro, who was known for his diligence but also for his envious nature. Taro often found himself comparing his progress to that of his fellow monks, feeling bitter when others received praise or showed more understanding in their practice.

One day, Master Gento called Taro to his quarters and presented him with two pots. One was made of plain clay, and the other was ornately decorated with intricate designs and gold leaf. Master Gento filled both pots with soil and planted a seed in each.

“Taro,” said Master Gento, “take care of these pots and observe them as the seeds grow.”

Over the weeks, Taro tended to both pots with equal care. The seeds sprouted and grew into plants. However, Taro noticed that the plant in the plain pot grew robust and vibrant, while the plant in the ornate pot was smaller and less vigorous.

Puzzled, Taro asked Master Gento, “Why has the plant in the plain pot flourished while the one in the ornate pot has not, even though I treated them the same?”

Master Gento smiled and replied, “The pots are like people's outward appearances and possessions, ornate or plain. But the growth of the plants depends on what is within – the soil and the seed. You, Taro, are like the plant, and your envy is like the ornate pot. It may seem significant from the outside, but it does not determine the quality of your growth. True growth comes from within, from your own efforts and virtues.”

Taro understood that his envy was like the deceptive beauty of the ornate pot, superficial and irrelevant to his true growth. From that day, he began to focus on his own path, cultivating his virtues and practice, without envy clouding his journey. He learned that contentment and personal growth come from within, not from comparing oneself to others.
