In a Zen monastery, there was a young monk who struggled with unwanted thoughts. Despite his efforts to focus on his meditation and teachings, these thoughts would often arise, causing him distress.

Seeking guidance, he approached the old Zen master of the monastery. "Master, I am troubled by unwanted thoughts. How can I cleanse my mind?" he asked.

The master, holding a cup of clear water, stirred a spoonful of dirt into it, making the water murky. He then placed the cup on the table and said, "Watch what happens to the water without any intervention."

The young monk observed the cup over time. Gradually, the dirt settled to the bottom, and the water became clear again.

The master then said, "Your mind is like this cup of water. Unwanted thoughts are like the dirt. Just as the dirt settles naturally if left undisturbed, so too will your unwanted thoughts settle if you do not cling to them or push them away. Observe them arise and fall without attachment or aversion, and your mind will return to its natural clarity."

The young monk understood that the key was not in fighting the thoughts, but in learning to observe them with detachment, allowing them to pass without affecting the inherent clarity and purity of his mind.
