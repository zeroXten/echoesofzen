In a Zen temple, there lived a monk who was known for his strict adherence to fasting as a form of spiritual discipline. However, one season, he found himself constantly tempted by thoughts of food during his fast.

Seeking guidance, he went to the temple's Zen master and said, "Master, I am tormented by the thought of food during my fast. How can I overcome this temptation?"

The master took the monk to the temple's kitchen, where a pot of delicious smelling stew was simmering. The master said, "Sit here and watch the pot. But remember, you must not lift the lid."

The monk sat by the pot, the aroma teasing his senses. Hours passed, and the temptation to peek under the lid grew stronger. Yet, he remembered the master's instruction and did not give in.

After a day and night, the master returned and asked, "What did you learn from watching the pot?"

The monk replied, "The temptation was great, but I realized that the act of resisting it strengthened my discipline. Not lifting the lid taught me that the strength to overcome temptation comes from within, not from avoiding or removing the object of desire."

The master nodded, "Just as you watched the pot without lifting the lid, observe your thoughts of food during your fast. Acknowledge them, but do not act on them. Your discipline is like the lid on the pot, preserving the essence of your spiritual practice."

The monk understood that the key to overcoming temptation was not in suppressing desire, but in observing it without succumbing to it, thus strengthening his spiritual resolve.
