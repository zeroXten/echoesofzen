In the Digital Lotus Temple, a young novice named Kenji approached Master Gento with a troubled heart. "Master Gento," he said, "I am struggling to interact with a fellow monk who is quick to anger. How can I find peace in his presence?"

Master Gento led Kenji to the temple's garden where a small stream flowed gently. He picked up a rock and tossed it into the stream. The water rippled violently around the rock, then gradually calmed and returned to its peaceful flow.

"Observe the water," Master Gento said. "When disturbed by the rock, it reacts, creating ripples and turbulence. But soon, it returns to its calm state, undisturbed by the rock's presence. Can you be like this stream?"

Kenji contemplated the water. He realized the master was teaching him about resilience and response. The water did not hold onto the disturbance; it returned to calmness as its natural state.

"Your peace should be like this stream," Master Gento continued. "The anger of others may disturb you momentarily, but do not let it alter your inner calm. Recognize the disturbance, but return to your peaceful nature, unaffected in the long run."

Kenji understood. To deal with someone quick to anger, he needed to cultivate his own inner peace, allowing external disturbances to ripple and pass, maintaining his tranquility amidst the turbulence.
