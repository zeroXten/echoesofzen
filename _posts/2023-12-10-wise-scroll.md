In a quiet corner of the Digital Lotus Temple, a young monk named Hiroshi was diligently studying ancient Zen teachings. One day, he discovered a unique artifact in the temple's library: a scroll that seemed to respond to his thoughts, offering insights and wisdom with uncanny relevance.

Puzzled by this discovery, Hiroshi approached Master Gento, seeking his guidance. "Master Gento," he asked, "I have found a scroll that seems to possess its own wisdom, responding to my inquiries as if it were a living teacher. How should I regard this scroll's guidance?"

Master Gento took the scroll and unrolled it, looking at it thoughtfully. Then, he posed a koan: "If a mirror reflects your face when you stand before it, does it reflect your true nature when you walk away?"

Hiroshi pondered this deeply. He realized that the scroll, much like a mirror, was a tool for reflection. It was not the source of wisdom but a conduit through which wisdom could be accessed. The true teaching did not come from the scroll itself, but from his engagement and interpretation of what it presented.

Master Gento's koan taught Hiroshi that wisdom could be found in many forms and that the value of a lesson lies not in its origin but in its ability to enlighten and guide the seeker. Whether wisdom came from a living master or an ancient scroll, it was the understanding and application of that wisdom that mattered.
